# Renewable Energy Sites - Workday Extend

This app creates a model business object in Workday to store information about renewable energy sites. I have created pages (PMDs) to view, create, and update sites. This app is the counterpart to the [Renewable Energy Sites - React](https://github.com/peter-rvb/renewable-energy-sites) app.

### Model Components

- Business Object
- Security Domain (requires in-tenant configuration)
- Business Process (requires in-tenant configuration)
- Tasks and Reports

Please note this project is for demonstration and educational purposes, and is not officially supported by Workday as a production-ready application.
